# ACES Strategy – Adaptive Cooperation and Exploitation Strategy

ACES is a dynamic algorithm for the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, built for adaptive play and smart opponent analysis.

The strategy combines exponential moving averages, betrayal memory, cycle and pattern detection, and probabilistic decision-making to balance cooperation and exploitation. It adjusts behavior over time to maximize points against a wide range of strategies.

## Features

- 📊 Adaptive evaluation of opponent behavior
- 🔁 Pattern and cycle recognition
- 🧠 Memory of betrayals for risk adjustment
- 🧩 Probabilistic decision-making with custom pseudo-random generator
- 🏁 End-game tactics for optimal closing plays
